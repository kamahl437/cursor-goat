== Goal 2: Don't Use Online Banking

=== Why Banking is a Prime Target

Financial institutions are the most targeted sector for phishing attacks, and for good reason:

* *High Value Target*: Access to your bank account provides immediate financial gain for attackers.

* *Brand Trust*: People tend to trust emails that appear to come from their bank, making these phishing attempts more successful.

* *Urgency*: Banking-related messages often create a sense of urgency ("suspicious activity detected," "account suspended"), pressuring users to act quickly without thinking.

=== Common Banking Phishing Techniques

1. *Fake Bank Emails*: Emails claiming to be from your bank, informing you of "suspicious activity" or "account verification required."

2. *Clone Websites*: Sophisticated replicas of banking websites that harvest your login credentials.

3. *SMS Phishing*: Text messages claiming to be from your bank with links to malicious websites.

4. *Vishing (Voice Phishing)*: Phone calls from individuals claiming to be bank representatives, asking for your account details.
