== Scenario 1: The IT Support Call

One of the most common vishing attacks targets businesses and individuals by impersonating IT support or help desk personnel.

=== The Scenario

_Your phone rings. The caller ID shows your company's name._

"Hello, this is Josh from IT Support. We've detected some unusual activity on your computer that suggests it might be infected with malware. I need to help you secure your system immediately before any sensitive data is compromised. I'll need your username and password to run some diagnostics, and I'll need you to install a remote support tool so I can clean your system."

=== Red Flags in This Scenario

* *Unsolicited call*: You didn't request IT support
* *Request for credentials*: Legitimate IT staff should never ask for your password
* *Urgency*: Creating a sense of immediate danger
* *Request to install software*: Could be malware or remote access tools
* *Name-dropping*: Using common names like "Josh" to seem familiar

=== Actual Attack Objective

The attacker is trying to:

1. Obtain your login credentials
2. Install remote access software to control your computer
3. Potentially deploy ransomware or data-stealing malware
4. Access sensitive corporate or personal information

=== Real-World Statistics

* 69% of organizations reported being targeted by voice phishing in 2022
* The average cost of a successful vishing attack on a business is $136,000
* IT support impersonation vishing attacks increased 47% during the COVID-19 pandemic when remote work became more common

=== How to Respond

* Hang up immediately
* Tell the caller you will call back through the official IT help desk number
* Refuse to provide any credentials over the phone
* Verify the request through official channels before taking any action
