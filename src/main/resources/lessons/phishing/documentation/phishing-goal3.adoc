== Goal 3: Don't Trust Josh

=== Verifying Sender Identity

One of the most critical aspects of phishing prevention is verifying the identity of message senders. In this lesson, we'll use "Josh" as our example of someone you should never trust without verification.

=== The Josh Problem

Josh is that friendly colleague who often sends you links, files, and requests for information. But how do you know if it's really Josh?

* *Email Spoofing*: Attackers can easily forge email headers to make messages appear to come from "josh@company.com"
* *Account Takeover*: Josh's actual account might be compromised
* *Similar Domains*: "j0sh@company.com" or "josh@cornpany.com" can look legitimate at a glance
* *Personal Information*: If an attacker knows Josh is your colleague, they can craft convincing messages

=== How to Verify Identity

To protect yourself from "Josh" and others:

* Verify requests through a different communication channel (call Josh if you get a suspicious email)
* Check email headers for inconsistencies
* Hover over links before clicking to see the true destination
* Be skeptical of unexpected requests, especially those involving money or credentials
* Use email signing and encryption where possible

Remember: *Trust, but verify* - especially when it comes to Josh!

*Now, answer the question below to demonstrate your understanding of who you should never trust.*
