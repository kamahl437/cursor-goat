== Scenario 3: The Survey Call

Survey and market research calls might seem harmless, but they can be cleverly disguised information-gathering operations for identity theft or future targeted attacks.

=== The Scenario

_Your phone rings in the middle of the day. The caller ID shows an unknown number._

"Hello, I'm conducting a quick 5-minute survey for Consumer Research Associates about shopping habits and financial services. Your responses will help improve customer experiences, and you'll receive a $50 gift card for your participation. I just need to confirm some basic information first - your full name, date of birth, address, and the name of your primary bank to ensure you qualify for our survey and gift card."

=== Red Flags in This Scenario

* *Unsolicited call*: You didn't sign up for any survey
* *Too good to be true*: $50 for a 5-minute survey is unusually generous
* *Request for personal information*: Legitimate surveys rarely need identifying details
* *Vague company name*: "Consumer Research Associates" is generic and difficult to verify
* *Requesting financial information*: No survey needs to know which bank you use

=== Actual Attack Objective

The attacker is trying to:

1. Collect personal information for identity theft
2. Build a profile on you for more targeted future attacks
3. Determine which bank to impersonate in follow-up phishing attempts
4. Establish rapport for ongoing social engineering

=== Real-World Statistics

* 65% of identity theft cases begin with giving information to someone posing as a legitimate business
* Fraudulent survey calls increased 700% during the pandemic
* The FTC reports that fake survey scams are among the top 10 consumer complaints
* 74% of consumers can't distinguish between legitimate market research and fraudulent surveys

=== How to Respond

Legitimate options for handling this situation include:

* Decline to participate in unsolicited surveys
* Never provide personal or financial information to unknown callers
* Ask for the company's website and tell them you'll participate online after researching them
* If interested in the survey, provide only non-identifying information (age range, general shopping preferences)
