== Goal 1: Don't Have a Facebook Account

=== Social Media and Phishing Risk

Social media platforms like Facebook collect vast amounts of personal information, which can be leveraged by attackers for sophisticated phishing attempts:

* *Personal Details*: Your date of birth, hometown, education, workplace, and family connections provide attackers with information to craft convincing messages.

* *Activity Timeline*: Your posts, check-ins, and life events help attackers understand your interests and activities, enabling them to time attacks effectively.

* *Friends List*: Knowledge of your connections allows attackers to impersonate trusted friends or family members.

=== Real-World Example

Consider this scenario: You receive an email that says, "Hi [Your Name], I noticed you visited [Restaurant you checked into last week] recently. I'm the manager and we found your credit card after you left. Please confirm your details on this form so we can return it to you."

This type of targeted attack is only possible because of the information you've shared on social media.

=== Mitigation Strategies

If you must use social media:

* Set your profile to private
* Limit the personal information you share
* Be skeptical of friend requests from unknown individuals
* Regularly review and restrict app permissions
* Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication

*Now, answer the question below to demonstrate your understanding of why not having a Facebook account reduces your phishing risk.*
